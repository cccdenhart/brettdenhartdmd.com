                "name": "Dental Implants",
                "desc": "Dental implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat virtually anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours will be preserved.\nDental implants are changing the way people live. With them, people are rediscovering the comfort and confidence to eat, speak, laugh and enjoy life."

                "name": "Wisdom Teeth",
                "desc": "If a wisdom tooth is deemed to be problematic, it will usually be extracted to avoid any potential oral complications. To have a wisdom tooth removed, a small incision in the gum tissue is made to expose the tooth and any bone that may be covering the tooth. Once the tooth is in view, it is gently grasped with a dental instrument, known as a forcep, and gently rocked back and forth to loosen it from the jawbone and surrounding ligaments. Occasionally, the tooth may need to be cut into smaller pieces to make it removal easier. Once the tooth has been removed, stitches may be placed to expedite the healing process."

            {
                "name": "Bone Grafting",
                "desc": "Bone grafting is the replacement or enhancement of bone around teeth. When a tooth is lost, the surrounding bone collapses. Bone grafting is performed to reverse bone loss or enhance existing bone. The grafting material can be taken from parts of the body or from synthetic material. Bone grafting allows for proper support of dental implants or prostheses."

            {
                "name": "Orthognathic Surgery",
                "desc": "Orthognathic surgery is done to correct misalignments or other abnormalities in the upper and/or lower jaw.\nOrthognathic surgery can involve procedures such as an osteotomy (bone cutting), bone grafts, or distraction osteogenes is (stretching of the bone) and orthodontic (braces) care.Orthognathic correction is conducted in stages, and the course of treatment can last from a few months to a year or more.\nIn order to perform the procedure successfully, the jawbones will be repositioned in accordance with one’s specific needs.Inconspicuous incisions are usually made inside, and if needed, outside the mouth to allow for surgical plates, screws, wires and rubber bands to be used to hold your jaws in their new positions."

                "name": "Facial Trauma",
                "desc": "Facial trauma involves injuries to the bone, teeth, skin, gums or other soft tissues.\nDepending on the type of facial trauma sustained, there are many different treatment options available. The primary goals of treatment are to stop any bleeding from occurring, create a clear airway, repair any broken or fractured bone, and or suture any damaged soft tissue. Treatment is immediate, as long as there are no neck fractures or life-threatening injuries."

                "desc": "A tooth that can not be saved with restorative materials may need to be removed. First, the area will be numbed with anesthesia. The tooth is then loosened with a special dental instrument known as an elevator. After the tooth is loosened from the socket, it is removed. Stitches may be necessary after the removal of a tooth."

                "name": "Frenectomies",
                "desc": "A frenectomy is a simple surgical procedure performed to release the connection of the “frenum,” a connective muscle between two tissues. There are two types of oral frenectomies that are frequently performed on both adults and children for a variety of reasons.\nA Labial Frenectomy is performed on the tissue that connects the lip to the gums. This may be performed on children or adults to aid with orthodontic treatment or even help with the proper fitting for a denture or appliance.\nA Lingual Frenectomy may also be referred to as the release of tongue-ties (ankyloglossia). This procedure is performed on the connective tissue under the tongue. The procedure is often performed on neonatal patients to assist with nursing or on toddlers or older patients who need the surgery to help correct speech issues caused by limited movement due the the frenum."

                "name": "TMJ",
                "desc": "The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is similar to a sliding hinge that connects your jawbone to your skull. TMJ disorders can cause pain in the jaw joint and in the muscles that control jaw movement.\nTo treat TMJ disorders, first the cause has to be identified. In less severe cases TMJ disorders can be treated with self-managed care (eating soft foods, using ice packs, avoiding extreme jaw movement) or nonsurgical treatments (anti-inflammatory medications, Botox injections, or stabilization splints). In severe cases surgical treatments (jaw joint replacements) may be necessary.\nTMJ conditions fall into three main categories:\nMyofascial pain – discomfort or pain in the muscles that control jaw function.\nInternal derangement of the joint – a possible indicator of a displaced disc, dislocated jaw, or injury to the condyle.\nArthritis – a degenerative inflammatory disorder."

With our KODAK Cone Beam system, our doctors are able to get a full 360 degree view of the tooth and all surrounding areas. The 3D Cone Beam scanner provides nearly limitless views of the teeth while using less radiation than traditional medical CT technology. This new technology is fast, simple and painless, providing many wonderful benefits that were unavailable only a few years ago."

Your doctor will combine the use of IV sedation along with a local anesthetic so you have little to no discomfort and will have no memory of the procedure.\nFor IV Sedation, patients’ vital signs, such as blood pressure and heart rate, are continuously monitored by our trained staff. Patients should plan to have someone bring them to the appointment and be available to drive them home following treatment."

                "desc": "Platelet Rich Growth Factors and Platelet Rich Fibrin are new techniques used to assist with tissue regeneration using the patient’s own tissues and centrifugation to minimize healing time and maximize healing potential following procedures.\nThese growth factors are in the form of a mixed gel that can be applied directly into tooth sockets and other sites. Placing this material in tooth sockets after tooth extractions can improve soft tissue healing and positively influence bone regeneration.\nThese techniques offer a new approach to tissue regeneration. PRP derives from the centrifugation of a patient’s own blood and contains growth factors that influence wound healing. This is important in tissue repairing mechanisms. The use of PRP in surgical practice could have beneficial outcomes, reducing bleeding and enhancing soft tissue healing and bone regeneration."

To correct impacted teeth, there are a few treatment options. For impacted wisdom teeth, the most common procedure is extraction. For impacted canine teeth, several treatment modalities are available. Orthodontics (braces) can be used to open space for proper eruption. Primary (baby) teeth can either be extracted or surgically exposed to allow for the placement of an orthodontic bracket to help align the teeth.\n"
