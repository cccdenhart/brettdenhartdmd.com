Orthognathic surgery is done to correct misalignments or other abnormalities in the upper and/or lower jaw.

Orthognathic surgery can involve procedures such as: 
- an osteotomy (bone cutting)
- bone grafts
- distraction osteogenes (stretching of the bone) 
- orthodontic (braces) care.

Orthognathic correction is conducted in stages, and the course of treatment can last from a few months to a year or more.

In order to perform the procedure successfully, the jawbones will be repositioned in accordance with oneâ€™s specific needs.  Inconspicuous incisions are usually made inside, and if needed, outside the mouth to allow for surgical plates, screws, wires and rubber bands to be used to hold your jaws in their new positions.
