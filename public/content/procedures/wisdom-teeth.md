If a wisdom tooth is deemed to be problematic, it will usually be extracted to avoid any potential oral complications. To have a wisdom tooth removed, a small incision in the gum tissue is made to expose the tooth and any bone that may be covering the tooth. Once the tooth is in view, it is gently grasped with a dental instrument, known as a forcep, and gently rocked back and forth to loosen it from the jawbone and surrounding ligaments. Occasionally, the tooth may need to be cut into smaller pieces to make it removal easier. Once the tooth has been removed, stitches may be placed to expedite the healing process.
